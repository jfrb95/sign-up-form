For this project I created a pretend form page for a pretend website. The general layout was decided by The Odin Project, as this is one of the projects on that website.

The Odin Project provided an image of what the website should look like. Aside from this, everything about this form page was created from scratch by me.

Some key features are:

 - styling the form using pseudo-selectors (see the password fields for an example of this).

 - laying the form out neatly.

 - using positioning to layer elements on top of and image.

Making the webpage scale nicely to different screen sizes was not part of the project, as that will be covered later.
